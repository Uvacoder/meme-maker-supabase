# Meme Maker
 Built with Next.JS, Supabase, Tailwind, and Fabric.JS

A project built for [Supabase's Hackathon]('https://supabase.io/blog/2021/07/30/1-the-supabase-hackathon'), probably will not be maintained thereafter. A very simplified interface to build and share memes!

## Additional features to do (If I had more time)
- Allow users to edit their saved memes
- Add more community features like liking memes and a "Meme of the Month" title
- Add undo functionality to the editor
- Allow adding of custom images to the editor (apart from a curated list of stickers)
